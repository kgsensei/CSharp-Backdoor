## C# Backdoor w/ Node.JS Server

Created by kgsensei for educational reasons.

## What Does This Do?

This backdoor gives you console access onto a targets
Windows computer. Through the dashboard (accessed through
a browser) you can type any commands you want to the
remote console. You can also change between multiple
clients at once. It will periodically check for new
clients connected to the server and let you access them
right from the comfort of your browser.

## Brief Explanation on Usage

To use this all you need to do is build the C# solution
and run the Node.JS server.

Please remember to change the target IP in the `Program.cs`
file so that it opens sockets to the right server.

Again, this is a real and powerful tool that will get
you into legal trouble if not used lawfully. I am not

use the tools I create.

## Legal Information

I have said it before and I will say it again. This is a
real tool and you will get in trouble if you use it
illegally. I am not and will never be responsible for the
way other people use the tools I create.
